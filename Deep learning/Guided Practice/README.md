# Deep Learning - Guided Practices

This is a collection of beginner-friendly tutorials and exercises to practice **Deep Learning** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. These exercises will help you understand how CNNs work, especially in tasks like image classification.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

### 1. **CNN Practice**
   - **What it is:** Learn the basics of **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs). CNNs are commonly used for image-related tasks like classification.
   - **What you will do:** You'll go through an exercise where you apply CNNs to classify images and understand how they work.

### 2. **CNN MNIST**
   - **What it is:** This is a classic exercise where you will use CNNs to classify images of handwritten numbers from the **MNIST dataset**.
   - **What you will do:** You'll train a CNN to recognize digits like 0, 1, 2, etc., in images.

### 3. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**
   - **What it is:** You will learn about a common problem in deep learning called the **Vanishing Gradient** problem, which happens when training deep neural networks.
   - **What you will do:** Understand what this problem is and how it affects model training.

### 4. **Torch Tutorial**
   - **What it is:** This is a tutorial to help you get started with **PyTorch**, a popular deep learning library used for building models.
   - **What you will do:** Learn how to use PyTorch to create simple deep learning models.
