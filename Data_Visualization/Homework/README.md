# Homework: Data Visualization

# The objective of this exercise is to practice data visualization skills using Seaborn library in Python. Students will be given a real-world dataset and will be asked to create visualizations to explore relationships and trends within the data.Downloading the Data:

# The data can be downloaded from the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon.Instructions

Import the necessary libraries (pandas, seaborn) and read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe.
Explore the data by printing the first few rows of the dataset using the head() method.
Create a scatter plot of the relationship between the attack and defense stats of the Pokemon using the seaborn scatterplot() function.
Create a histogram of the distribution of the Pokemon's speed stat using the seaborn distplot() function.
Create a line plot of the changes in the average Pokemon attack and defense stats over time (generation) using the seaborn lineplot() function.
Create a bar plot of the number of legendary and non-legendary Pokemon using the seaborn countplot() function.
Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix between the various Pokemon stats using the seaborn heatmap() function.
Bonus: Create a pair plot of all the numeric variables in the dataset using the seaborn pairplot() function.
Bonus: Create a violin plot of the distribution of the various Pokemon types (water, fire, grass, etc.) and their corresponding attack stats using the seaborn violinplot() function.

# Save each plot as a separate image file for future reference.
Note: Don't forget to add appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends to your visualizations to make them more informative and easy to understand.
