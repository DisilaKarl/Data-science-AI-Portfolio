a single column (can be multiple rows) of values.\n","* [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html) - multiple columns/rows of values (a DataFrame is comprised of multiple Series).\n","* [Importing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we used [`pd.read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#pandas-read-csv) to read in a CSV (comma-separated values) file but there are multiple options for reading data.\n","* [Exporting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we exported our data using `to_csv()`, however there are multiple methods of exporting data.\n","* [Describing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html)\n","    * `df.dtypes` - find the datatypes present in a dataframe.\n","    * `df.describe()` - find various numerical features of a dataframe.\n","    * `df.info()` - find the number of rows and whether or not any of them are empty.\n","* [Viewing and selecting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#viewing-data)\n","    * `df.head()` - view the first 5 rows of `df`.\n","    * `df.loc` & `df.iloc` - select specific parts of a dataframe.\n","    * `df['A']` - select column `A` of `df`.\n","    * `df[df['A'] > 1000]` - selection column `A` rows with values over 1000 of `df`.\n","    * `df['A']` - plot values from column `A` using matplotlib (defaults to line graph).\n","* [Manipulating data and performing operations](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#operations) - pandas has many built-in functions you can use to manipulate data, also many of the Python operators (e.g. `+`, `-`, `>`, `==`) work with pandas.\n","\n","### Further reading\n","Since pandas is such a large library, it would be impossible to cover it all in one go.\n","\n","The following are some resources you might want to look into for more.\n","* [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) -
