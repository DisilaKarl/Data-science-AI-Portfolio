Project: AI-Based Hand X-Ray Abnormality Detection

Objective & Importance of the Dataset:

This project aims to detect abnormalities in hand X-ray images using deep learning models. The dataset consists of X-ray images of my own hands, which are unfortunately not operable at the moment. Since traditional medical approaches do not provide a solution, I want to explore AI-based detection techniques.

By training a model on normal and abnormal hand X-rays, the goal is to create an AI system that can identify specific anomalies and, in the future, help guide potential new surgical or treatment techniques.

Future Goals This project is not just about classifying normal vs. abnormal hands. It could evolve into:

Segmenting affected areas (e.g., using U-Net)
Exploring possible AI-assisted surgery planning
Deploying the model for easy medical testing access
By refining this system, AI could play a role in detecting and analyzing non-operable hand conditions, potentially helping others or myself in similar situations.
