# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio!

This repository contains all the major projects, assignments, and exercises completed during my Data Science & AI Bootcamp.
Throughout the program, I used my skills in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and AI to build practical and applied solutions.
All work was developed and executed using Google Colab.

Projects Overview : 

1. Data Analysis
Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Used libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to generate insights from real-world datasets.

Completed several projects and assignments related to data manipulation and visualization.

2. Classical Machine Learning
Built and evaluated traditional machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

Worked on supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

Developed assignments and small projects to practice model evaluation and optimization.

3. Deep Learning: Neural Networks
Developed and trained deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras.

Built neural networks for regression and classification problems.

Completed exercises and mini-projects focused on improving model accuracy and generalization.

4. Deep Learning: Computer Vision
Implemented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.

Worked on computer vision challenges using real datasets.

Delivered projects and exercises on improving computer vision model performance.

5. Deep Learning: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Built NLP models for text classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation.

Used tokenization, embedding layers, and RNN/LSTM architectures.

Completed practical assignments on natural language understanding and text prediction.

Final Project : Hand Malformation Detection
Combined the skills acquired throughout the bootcamp into a final comprehensive project.

Integrated data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to solve a complex real-world problem.
