# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio!

Hello and welcome to my GitHub! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and exercises showcasing my journey in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Development. This repository reflects both my training and hands-on experience across various domains, including homework assignments, guided sessions from my bootcamp, as well as bootcamp and personal projects.

## Projects

### Data Analysis
This section includes projects focused on data collection, exploration, cleaning, and visualization. Using statistical techniques and various visualization tools, I extract meaningful insights from diverse datasets.

### Machine Learning
Here, you'll find projects involving predictive modeling, performance evaluation, and result visualization. I work with both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn.

### Deep Learning
This directory features implementations of deep neural networks, including model training, performance analysis, and result visualization. Projects utilize frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

### Computer Vision
Projects in this section involve image processing, object detection, and image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV. Tasks range from basic image transformations to advanced feature extraction.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This category includes projects on text processing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and language modeling. I use libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and transformers to explore the power of NLP.

### Development
Beyond AI and Data Science, I also work on software development projects. This includes API development, automation scripts, and web applications using Python, Flask, and JavaScript.

### Bootcamp Projects & Homework
This section contains all my homework assignments, guided session exercises, and projects from my bootcamp. It showcases my learning process and hands-on application of concepts.

### Personal Projects
Beyond structured coursework, I also work on personal projects exploring new technologies and innovative solutions in AI, data science, and software development.

### Final Project: Hand Malformation Detection
As part of my bootcamp, I am working on a final project focused on detecting hand malformations using deep learning. This project involves medical image analysis, computer vision techniques, and neural networks to provide an accurate classification. I will be presenting this work in front of a jury.
