## Data Analysis

This directory contains a collection of exercises designed to improve your data analysis skills. The exercises cover a wide range of tasks, including data exploration, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. 

These exercises will help you understand how to handle and process data, identify patterns, and extract insights from various datasets.

## 1. Data Exploration
Exercise: Download a public dataset (e.g., Iris Dataset) and perform the following tasks:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Explore the columns and their data types.
Use functions like .info(), .describe(), and .shape() to get summaries of the data.
Objectives:

Familiarize yourself with basic data exploration using pandas.
Get an overview of the dataset structure and basic statistics.

## 2. Data Cleaning
Exercise: Download the Titanic Dataset and perform the following tasks:

Identify missing values and decide whether to replace or drop them.
Handle non-numeric columns (e.g., encode categories like "male" / "female").
Remove outliers using methods like IQR or z-scores.
Objectives:

Learn how to clean data by handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
Handle outliers and prepare data for further analysis or modeling.

## 3. Data Manipulation
Exercise: Use a dataset like the Superstore Dataset and perform the following tasks:

Group the data by category or region and calculate aggregated statistics (e.g., sum, average, etc.).
Create new columns based on calculations (e.g., profit = revenue - cost).
Reshape the data using pivot tables.
Objectives:

Practice data aggregation, transformation, and reshaping.
Understand how to manipulate data to get insights and create new features.

## 4. Data Visualization
Exercise: Use the Netflix Dataset and perform the following tasks:

Create histograms to show the distribution of movie durations.
Create bar charts for the most popular genres.
Use a scatter plot to show the relationship between the movie duration and the year of release.
Objectives:

Learn how to create basic visualizations to explore and present data.
Practice using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize distributions and relationships.

## 5. Statistical Analysis
Exercise: Use a medical dataset like the Diabetes Dataset and perform the following tasks:

Compare the means of various variables for diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) to check if the differences observed are statistically significant.
Calculate the correlation between key variables and interpret the results.
Objectives:

Perform basic statistical analysis to compare groups and understand relationships between variables.
Learn how to test hypotheses and interpret the results of statistical tests.

## 6. Additional Projects

# Exercise 1: Sales Analysis for an Online Store
Dataset: E-commerce Dataset

## Tasks:
Identify the most sold products.
Analyze purchase behavior by region and time of day.
Objectives:

Understand how to segment and analyze e-commerce data.
Exercise 2: Predicting Housing Prices
Dataset: Housing Prices Dataset

## Tasks:
Analyze the factors that have the most impact on house prices.
Perform linear regression to predict house prices based on various features.
Objectives:

Apply regression techniques to predict continuous values.
Learn to interpret the results of a regression model.
