## This repository contains notebooks focused on essential data analysis, statistical techniques, and hypothesis testing. The notebooks explore fundamental concepts in data manipulation, hypothesis testing, and statistics practice.

## Notebooks
## 1. CLA-01-Introduction-to-pandas.ipynb
This notebook introduces pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It covers data structures like Series and DataFrames, as well as techniques for loading, cleaning, and exploring data.

## 2. G_Day02_Hypothesis_Testing_Confidence_intervall.ipynb
This notebook explores hypothesis testing and the concept of confidence intervals. It covers topics such as the formulation of null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, and understanding the results of statistical tests.

## 3. G_DAY2_Statistics_practice.ipynb
A practical notebook to solidify the concepts of statistics. It includes exercises on statistical measures like mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and more. It also covers the application of these concepts in data analysis.

## Key Techniques Covered

## 1. Introduction to pandas
Data Structures: Series and DataFrames.
Data Loading: Reading data from CSV, Excel, and other file formats.
Data Exploration: Summary statistics, filtering, and selecting data.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, duplicates, and basic transformations.

## 2. Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals
Null and Alternative Hypotheses: Formulating hypotheses for statistical tests.
P-values: Interpreting the significance of test results.
Confidence Intervals: Understanding the range of values that likely contain the true population parameter.

## 3. Statistics Practice
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
Data Visualization: Using plots to understand the data distribution.
Basic Statistical Tests: Understanding and applying tests such as t-tests and chi-square tests.

## Usage
