### Homework 1
- **Topic**:
The objective of this exercise is to perform data exploration using Pandas and to calculate various statistical measures for a real dataset. By the end of the exercise, you should be able to:
Load a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
Explore the structure and format of the data
Calculate measures of central tendency, variability, and shape
Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing
-**Instructions** : 
Load the "Iris" dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using the code provided above.
* Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the "head()" method.
* Check the shape of the DataFrame using the "shape" attribute.
* Check the data types of each column using the "dtypes" attribute.
* Check for missing values in the DataFrame using the "isnull()" method and the "sum()" method.
* Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the "sepal length (cm)" column.
* Calculate the range, variance, and standard deviation for the "petal width (cm)" column.
* Calculate the skewness and kurtosis for the "sepal width (cm)" column.
* Count the number of unique values in the "target" column using the "nunique()" method.
* Group the data by the "target" column and calculate the mean for each group using the "groupby()" method and the "mean()" method.
- **Description**:
This assignment covers the basic techniques of handling and exploring raw datasets. It includes steps such as data cleaning and missing value imputation.
- **Dataset** :
For this exercise, we will be using the "Iris" dataset, which contains information about three species of iris flowers.
