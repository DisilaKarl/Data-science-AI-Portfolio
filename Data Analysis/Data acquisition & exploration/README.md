## Data Acquisition and Exploration

This directory contains notebooks and exercises related to Data Acquisition and Data Exploration. The focus is on techniques for collecting, cleaning, and exploring data using various tools and methods.

## Notebooks

## 1. CLA-01-Introduction-to-pandas.ipynb
This notebook introduces the pandas library, focusing on data manipulation techniques such as:

Working with Series and DataFrames.
Data loading from different sources (CSV, Excel, etc.).
Basic data cleaning and exploratory techniques.

## 2. G_Day02_Hypothesis_Testing_Confidence_intervall.ipynb
This notebook covers the fundamental concepts of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Topics include:

Null and alternative hypotheses formulation.
