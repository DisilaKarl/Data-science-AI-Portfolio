## Data Cleaning and Preparation Notebooks
This repository contains notebooks focused on essential data cleaning techniques, including handling missing values, detecting and managing outliers, addressing imbalanced data, normalizing and scaling data, and encoding categorical variables.

## Notebooks
## 1. Missing_values_student.ipynb
A notebook to handle missing values. It includes methods like imputation and removal to ensure data completeness.

## 2. Outliers.ipynb
This notebook focuses on detecting and handling outliers using statistical methods such as IQR (Interquartile Range) and Z-score.

## 3. Imbalanced_data.ipynb
A notebook to address imbalanced data issues, with techniques like oversampling and undersampling to balance the dataset.

## 4. Normalization_and_Scaling.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to normalize and scale data, ensuring features have a similar range and distribution for effective model performance.

## 5. Practice (Outliers, Missing Values, Imbalanced Data, and Categorical Encoding).ipynb
A practice notebook covering all of the techniques above, along with categorical encoding, enabling you to work on real-world data preprocessing tasks.
