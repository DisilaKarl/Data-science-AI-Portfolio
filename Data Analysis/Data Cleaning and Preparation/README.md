## Data Cleaning and Preparation

This project contains notebooks that cover essential data cleaning steps, including handling missing values, detecting outliers, addressing imbalanced data, normalizing and scaling data, and encoding categorical variables.

## Steps Covered
## 1. Missing Values
Identify and handle missing values using imputation techniques or by removing them.

## 2. Outliers
Detect and manage outliers using statistical methods like IQR or Z-score.

## 3. Imbalanced Data
Handle imbalanced datasets using techniques such as undersampling or oversampling.

## 4. Normalizing and Scaling
Apply normalization and scaling techniques to make the data suitable for modeling.

## 5. Categorical Encoding
Encode categorical variables using methods such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
