Supervised machine learning algorithms are a type of algorithms used to
train a model to predict a desired output based on input data. In this type of
learning, the algorithm is provided with a set of labelled examples
(input/output pairs), and its goal is to learn a general mapping between
inputs and outputs that can be used to predict outputs for unseen data.
