# Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction Homework

This homework focuses on **feature selection**, **feature extraction**, and **dimensionality reduction** techniques to preprocess datasets and improve machine learning models.

## Tasks
1. Select the most relevant features using methods like correlation and feature importance.
2. Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality and visualize explained variance.
3. Use **t-SNE** or **UMAP** for high-dimensional data visualization.
4. Compare the performance of models before and after dimensionality reduction.
